The payload in a token (like JWT) contains the user-specific data that the server and client need to verify the user’s identity and permissions. This data is embedded inside the token and is used to authenticate the user in a stateless way.

When a token is generated, the payload is encoded (but not encrypted) and included inside the token. The server can then verify this data without needing to query a database on every request.

📦 What Type of Payload Should I Use?
You should only include minimal and necessary data in the payload, avoiding sensitive information.

✅ Recommended Payload (Safe to Include)
User ID (_id) → Unique identifier for the user.
Role (role) → Defines user access (e.g., "admin", "user", "recruiter").
Username (name) → Display name.
Email (email) → If needed for verification.
Expiration Time (exp) → When the token expires.
Example Payload:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "userId": "64aabc123efg456",
  "role": "admin",
  "name": "Shubhanshu",
  "exp": 1710000000
}
❌ What Should I Avoid in the Payload?
Since JWTs are not encrypted by default (only base64 encoded), you should avoid including sensitive information.

🚫 Avoid These in Payload:
Passwords → Never include passwords in the token.
Sensitive Personal Data → Avoid storing phone numbers, addresses, or government IDs.
Bank/Card Details → Payment information should never be in a token.
Excess Data → Keep the token small to reduce network overhead.
Secrets or API Keys → Keep them on the server side.
❌ Example of a Bad Payload:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "userId": "64aabc123efg456",
  "password": "hashedPassword123",
  "creditCard": "4242424242424242",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "address": "123 Main St"
}
⚡ Final Best Practices
✅ Keep payload small and relevant.
✅ Include user ID and role, but avoid sensitive details.
✅ Use token expiration (exp) for security.
✅ For highly sensitive data, store it securely on the server and use session-based authentication instead of JWT.
